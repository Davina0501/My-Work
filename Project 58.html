<p>When I come home from school and have finished my homework I always make sure I have finished my projects and quizzes, if I haven't then I attempt to complete them.
    Sometimesin my spare time after doing my chores on Saturday, I often try to make my own apps but I never succeed, but I learn form my mistakes. When I am doing coding I can let my imagination go wild without having any set boundaries to my work and creations.
